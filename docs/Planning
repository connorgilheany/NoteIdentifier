Authenticated users:
	Each request includes the authorization header
	Are able to track their history & progress (scoreboard?)

Unauthenticated users:
	No auth header, but the requests themselves are the exact same


So,

I need each request to go through middleware that logs actions for authenticated users, but not unauthenticated users


Should there be one UUID per note, or one UUID per sequence?
    -> We could store each request as a sequence, even if it's a single note (sequence of one)
